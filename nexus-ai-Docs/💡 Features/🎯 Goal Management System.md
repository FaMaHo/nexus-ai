## Overview

The Goal Management System is the **strategic core** of nexus-ai. It transforms abstract aspirations into concrete, actionable plans while maintaining the connection between daily tasks and long-term vision.

## Core Philosophy

> **"A goal without a plan is just a wish. A plan without execution tracking is just hope."**

### Design Principles

1. **Goal Hierarchy**: Big goals break into smaller goals, which break into tasks
2. **SMART Enhancement**: Beyond traditional SMART goals with context awareness
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Goals evolve based on progress and changing circumstances
4. **Progress Visibility**: Always know where you stand and what's next

## Goal Types & Structure

### 1. Vision Goals (6+ months)

**Purpose**: Life direction and major achievements **Examples**:

- "Become a skilled full-stack developer"
- "Establish healthy lifestyle habits"
- "Graduate with honors"

**Properties**:

- No specific deadline (ongoing)
- Broad success criteria
- Multiple sub-goals
- Regular review cycles

### 2. Project Goals (1-6 months)

**Purpose**: Specific achievements with clear outcomes **Examples**:

- "Learn React and build 3 projects"
- "Lose 10kg and maintain for 3 months"
- "Complete database systems course with A grade"

**Properties**:

- Clear deadline
- Measurable outcome
- Defined scope
- Resource requirements

### 3. Sprint Goals (1-4 weeks)

**Purpose**: Short-term focused achievements **Examples**:

- "Complete React fundamentals tutorial"
- "Establish morning exercise routine"
- "Study for midterm exam"

**Properties**:

- Specific deliverable
- Time-boxed
- Daily actionable tasks
- Regular check-ins

## Goal Decomposition Algorithm

### Automatic Breakdown Process

```python
def decompose_goal(goal):
    """
    Intelligent goal decomposition based on:
    - Goal type and complexity
    - Available time until deadline
    - Historical similar goals
    - Current context and constraints
    """
    if goal.is_complex():
        sub_goals = create_sub_goals(goal)
        for sub_goal in sub_goals:
            tasks = generate_tasks(sub_goal)
            schedule_tasks(tasks, consider_dependencies=True)
    else:
        tasks = generate_tasks(goal)
        optimize_task_order(tasks)
```

### Decomposition Rules

#### Complex Goals → Sub-Goals

**Trigger**: Goals with >40 hour estimates or >3 month timelines **Process**:

1. Identify major components/phases
2. Create sub-goals for each component
3. Establish dependencies between sub-goals
4. Set milestone checkpoints

#### Simple Goals → Direct Tasks

**Trigger**: Goals with <40 hour estimates or <1 month timelines **Process**:

1. Break into 2-4 hour task chunks
2. Sequence tasks logically
3. Identify prerequisites
4. Set realistic deadlines

### Example Decomposition: "Learn React Development"

```
🎯 Vision Goal: "Become Full-Stack Developer" (12 months)
├── 🎯 Project Goal: "Master Frontend Development" (4 months)
│   ├── 🎯 Sprint Goal: "Learn React Fundamentals" (3 weeks)
│   │   ├── ✅ Task: "Setup development environment" (2h)
│   │   ├── ✅ Task: "Complete React official tutorial" (8h)
│   │   ├── 🔄 Task: "Build todo app project" (6h)
│   │   └── ⏳ Task: "Learn React hooks" (4h)
│   ├── 🎯 Sprint Goal: "State Management & APIs" (2 weeks)
│   └── 🎯 Sprint Goal: "Build Portfolio Project" (3 weeks)
└── 🎯 Project Goal: "Learn Backend Development" (4 months)
```

## CLI Commands Design

### Core Goal Operations

# Goal Creation with Smart Decomposition
nexus goal add "Learn React Development" \
    --type project \
    --deadline "2025-08-31" \
    --priority high \
    --category education \
    --auto-decompose

# Goal Management
nexus goal list                           # Show all active goals
nexus goal list --type sprint            # Filter by type
nexus goal view react-learning-id        # Detailed view with tasks
nexus goal update react-learning-id --priority medium
nexus goal archive react-learning-id     # Mark as completed

# Goal Analysis

nexus goal impact react-learning-id           # Show what depends on this

# Goal Templates
nexus goal template create "Programming Language Learning"
nexus goal from-template "Learn Python" --template programming-lang
nexus goal template list

# Goal Review & Reflection
nexus goal review weekly                       # Weekly goal review
nexus goal retrospective completed-goal-id    # Learn from completed goals
nexus goal adjust react-learning-id           # Update based on progress
```

## Progress Tracking System

### Progress Metrics

1. **Completion Percentage**: Based on completed sub-goals/tasks
2. **Time Investment**: Actual vs estimated time spent
3. **Momentum Score**: Recent activity and consistency
4. **Difficulty Assessment**: How challenging it's been vs expectations
5. **External Factors**: Events that helped or hindered progress

### Progress Calculation Algorithm

```python
def calculate_goal_progress(goal):
    """
    Multi-dimensional progress calculation
    Note: completion_percentage is calculated, not stored in database
    """
    # Calculate completion based on completed tasks
    total_tasks = len(goal.tasks)
    completed_tasks = len([t for t in goal.tasks if t.status == 'completed'])
    task_completion_rate = completed_tasks / total_tasks if total_tasks > 0 else 0
    # Weight factors based on goal type and user preferences
    task_completion_weight = 0.4
    time_investment_weight = 0.3
    momentum_weight = 0.2
    quality_weight = 0.1
    
    progress = {
        'completion': calculate_task_completion_rate(goal),
        'time_efficiency': calculate_time_efficiency(goal),
        'momentum': calculate_momentum_score(goal),
        'quality': get_quality_feedback(goal)
    }
    
    weighted_score = (
        progress['completion'] * task_completion_weight +
        progress['time_efficiency'] * time_investment_weight +
        progress['momentum'] * momentum_weight +
        progress['quality'] * quality_weight
    )
    
    return {
        'overall_progress': weighted_score,
        'breakdown': progress,
        'predicted_completion': predict_completion_date(goal),
        'recommendations': generate_progress_recommendations(goal)
    }
```

## Goal Intelligence Features

### 1. Smart Goal Suggestions

**Context-Aware Recommendations**:

- Based on completed goals and interests
- Considering available time and energy
- Aligned with larger vision goals
- Seasonal and calendar-aware

```bash
nexus goal suggest                        # Get goal recommendations
nexus goal suggest --category education   # Filtered suggestions
nexus goal suggest --time-available 20h   # Based on available time
```

### 2. Goal Conflict Detection

**Automatic Conflict Resolution**:

- Timeline conflicts (overlapping deadlines)
- Resource conflicts (time/energy overcommitment)
- Dependency conflicts (prerequisite issues)
- Priority conflicts (too many high-priority goals)

### 3. Goal Adaptation Engine

**Dynamic Goal Adjustment**:

```python
class GoalAdaptationEngine:
    def analyze_goal_health(self, goal):
        """
        Continuous goal health monitoring
        """
        health_factors = {
            'progress_rate': self.get_progress_velocity(goal),
            'deadline_pressure': self.calculate_deadline_pressure(goal),
            'resource_availability': self.assess_resources(goal),
            'external_changes': self.detect_context_changes(goal),
            'motivation_level': self.assess_engagement(goal)
        }
        
        if health_factors['deadline_pressure'] > 0.8:
            return self.suggest_deadline_adjustment(goal)
        elif health_factors['progress_rate'] < 0.3:
            return self.suggest_task_simplification(goal)
        elif health_factors['motivation_level'] < 0.4:
            return self.suggest_approach_change(goal)
```

## Goal Review & Reflection System

### Weekly Goal Review Process

```bash
nexus goal review weekly
```

**Interactive Review Flow**:

1. **Progress Assessment**: What % complete is each active goal?
2. **Time Analysis**: How much time was invested vs planned?
3. **Obstacle Identification**: What blocked progress?
4. **Success Recognition**: What went better than expected?
5. **Adjustment Planning**: What needs to change for next week?

### Monthly Strategic Review

```bash
nexus goal review monthly
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

1. **Goal Portfolio Balance**: Are goals well-distributed across life areas?
2. **Resource Allocation**: Is time/energy optimally distributed?
3. **Vision Alignment**: Do current goals support long-term vision?
4. **Goal Retirement**: Should any goals be archived or cancelled?
5. **New Goal Planning**: What new goals should be added?

### Goal Completion Retrospective

```bash
nexus goal retrospective completed-goal-id
```

**Learning Extraction**:

1. **Success Factors**: What made this goal successful?
2. **Improvement Areas**: What could have been done better?
3. **Time Estimation**: How accurate were original estimates?
4. **Skill Development**: What skills were gained?
5. **Future Application**: How can learnings apply to future goals?
