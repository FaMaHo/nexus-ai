    - [ ] Optimal scheduling recommendations
    - [ ] Performance trend analysis
- [ ] Predictive features
    - [ ] Goal completion probability
    - [ ] Time estimation refinement
    - [ ] Burnout prevention signals
- [ ] Export and reporting features

### Days 19-21: Polish & Optimization

- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Enhanced error handling
- [ ] Data backup and recovery
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Testing and bug fixes

## Daily Development Routine

### Morning (30 min)

1. Review yesterday's progress in [[Task Tracking]]
2. Plan today's development tasks
3. Update this timeline with actual progress

### Development Session Structure

1. **Code** (90 min) → **Test** (30 min) → **Break** (15 min)
2. **Document** (30 min) → **Review** (15 min)
3. Update Obsidian notes with learnings

### Evening (15 min)

1. Log progress in [[Task Tracking]]
2. Note any blockers or insights
3. Plan tomorrow's priorities

## Milestones & Testing Points

### MVP 1 (End of Day 3)

- [ ] Basic goal and task CRUD works
- [ ] CLI is functional and user-friendly
- [ ] Database operations are reliable
- **Test**: Create a real goal, break it into tasks, mark some complete

### MVP 2 (End of Day 7)

- [ ] Calendar integration working
- [ ] Can generate intelligent daily schedules
- [ ] Reclaim.ai workflow established
- **Test**: Plan an actual day and follow the schedule

### MVP 3 (End of Day 14)

- [ ] Learning from behavior patterns
- [ ] Significant productivity insights
- [ ] System feels genuinely helpful
- **Test**: Use for a full week and measure impact

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

1. **Google Calendar API complexity**
    - _Mitigation_: Start with read-only, simple authentication
2. **Algorithm complexity for scheduling**
    - _Mitigation_: Start simple, iterate based on real usage
3. **CLI user experience**
    - _Mitigation_: Focus on most common workflows first

### Potential Delays

- OAuth setup issues (add 1 day buffer)
- Algorithm tuning (add 2 day buffer)
- Unexpected API limitations (add 1 day buffer)

## Success Criteria

### Technical

- [ ] All core commands work reliably
- [ ] Calendar sync completes in <5 seconds
- [ ] CLI response time <200ms for all commands
- [ ] Zero data loss during normal operations

### Functional

- [ ] Can plan a full day in under 2 minutes
- [ ] Recommendations feel genuinely helpful
- [ ] System learns and improves over time
- [ ] Integrates smoothly with existing workflow

### Personal

- [ ] Actually use the system daily
- [ ] Feel more organized and focused
- [ ] Spend less time on planning, more on doing
- [ ] Make measurable progress on long-term goals
