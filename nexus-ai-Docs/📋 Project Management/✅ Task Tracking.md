## Development Methodology

### Daily Routine

**Morning Planning (15 min)**:

1. Review [[Development Timeline]] progress
2. Update today's priority tasks above
3. Set energy and focus intentions

**Development Sessions (90-120 min blocks)**:

1. **Focus Time**: Deep work on current task
2. **Testing**: Verify functionality works
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant notes
4. **Commit**: Git commit with clear message

**Evening Review (10 min)**:

1. Log actual time spent and efficiency
2. Note any blockers or insights
3. Plan tomorrow's top 3 priorities

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Feature branch for each major component
git checkout -b feature/database-schema
git checkout -b feature/cli-interface
git checkout -b feature/goal-management

# Commit frequently with descriptive messages
git commit -m "feat: implement basic goal CRUD operations"
git commit -m "fix: handle invalid date input in goal creation"
git commit -m "docs: update database schema with new indexes"

# Note: Use singular command forms (nexus goal add, not nexus goals add)
```

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Each database operation
- **Integration Tests**: CLI commands end-to-end
- **Manual Testing**: Real usage scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Database query timing
