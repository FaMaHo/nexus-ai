## Mission Statement

Create an intelligent personal assistant that understands my goals, learns from my behavior patterns, and provides strategic guidance for optimal daily planning and life orchestration.

## Core Philosophy

> "Intelligence is not about replacing human decision-making, but amplifying human potential through strategic insights."

### Principles

- **CLI-First Approach**: Speed and focus over flashy interfaces
- **Integration Over Replacement**: Works with existing tools ([[Calendar Integration]], [[System Design]])
- **Learning-Based Intelligence**: Adapts to personal patterns and preferences
- **Privacy-Focused**: All data stays local and under personal control
- **Strategic Thinking**: Focus on long-term goals, not just daily tasks

## Problem Statement

Current planning tools are either:

- Too simple (basic todo lists)
- Too complex (enterprise project management)
- Don't learn from behavior
- Don't connect goals to daily actions
- Don't consider personal energy patterns and context

## Solution Overview

A **Strategic Nexus** that:

1. **Understands Goals**: Breaks down complex objectives into actionable steps
2. **Learns Patterns**: Analyzes what works and what doesn't
3. **Optimizes Scheduling**: Suggests optimal timing based on energy, deadlines, and dependencies
4. **Provides Context**: Considers calendar, mood, energy levels, and external factors

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative

- [ ] Reduce daily planning time by 80% (from 30min to 6min)
- [ ] Increase goal completion rate by 50%
- [ ] Achieve 90% accuracy in time estimates
- [ ] Maintain 95% system uptime and reliability

### Qualitative

- [ ] Feel more in control of long-term direction
- [ ] Reduce decision fatigue in daily planning
- [ ] Increase awareness of personal productivity patterns
- [ ] Feel confident about progress toward major goals

## Target User (Myself)

- **Context**: University student in summer break
- **Challenges**: Irregular sleep schedule, multiple projects, long-term goals
- **Needs**: Structure without rigidity, goal-oriented planning, learning from patterns
- **Tools**: Already using Reclaim.ai, Google Calendar, wants CLI efficiency

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

- [[Database Schema]] implementation
- Basic [[CLI Interface]] with core commands
- [[Goal Management System]] MVP
- [[Calendar Integration]] read-only

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Week 2-3)

- [[Smart Scheduling Engine]] implementation
- [[Learning Analytics]] basic pattern recognition
- Daily reporting and feedback loop
- Reclaim.ai workflow integration

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 4+)

- Advanced learning algorithms
- Predictive recommendations
- Performance analytics dashboard
- [[Future Features]] implementation

## Related Notes

- [[Database Schema]] - Data structure planning
- [[Development Timeline]] - Detailed project schedule
- [[Task Tracking]] - Current development status

## Daily Questions for Alignment

1. Does this feature help achieve long-term goals?
2. Does this reduce cognitive load or increase it?
3. Will this learn and improve over time?
4. Does this integrate well with existing workflow?
